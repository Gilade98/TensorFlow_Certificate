# TensorFlow Certificate Journey Repository

Welcome to my TensorFlow Certificate Journey Repository! ðŸš€

## About

This repository documents my learning path and projects as I work towards earning the TensorFlow Certificate. Following the recommended resources on the official TensorFlow website, I am currently enrolled in the Professional Certificate - 4 course series offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera. This series covers essential topics in TensorFlow, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, natural language processing, sequences, time series, and prediction.

## Certification Goal

My ultimate goal is to attain proficiency in using TensorFlow for building and deploying machine learning models. The TensorFlow Certificate serves as a testament to my skills and understanding of this powerful framework, and I'm excited to share my experiences and insights with the community.

## Directory Structure

- `01_Intro_to_TF`: Basic examples and exercises covering the fundamentals of TensorFlow.
- `02_CNN_in_TF`: Projects and exercises focused on Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow.
- `03_NLP_in_TF`: Natural Language Processing projects and exercises using TensorFlow.
- `04_Sequences_TimeSeries_Preds`: Projects related to sequences, time series, and prediction using TensorFlow.

Feel free to explore the directories and projects to follow along with my learning journey.
