Working with Transfer Learning: <br> 

1 - imports  
2 - load data   
3 - explore the data  
4 - create generators  
5 - create pretrained model  
  -5.1 - download weights  
  -5.2 - instantiate model  
6 - create callback  
7 - pipline pretrained with own layers  
8 - compile model  
9 - train model  
10 - plot
